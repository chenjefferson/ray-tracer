# Learning Ray Tracing
## Goal
I want to write a ray tracer from scratch.

- It should be demoable. Someone should be able to read the README and download
a file to run it, and be able to compile it from scratch.
- It should be interactive. There should be a way for users to move things around,
change perspective, etc.
- It should look good. This is more subjective, but I'd say "looks more realistic
than a modern game but without textures" is a reasonable, if lofty bar.
- It should run reasonably fast, i.e. it should be runnable at > 1 FPS on my
4 year-old laptop.
