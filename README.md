# Ray Tracing

This is a simple ray-tracing demo that I built in order to sharpen my math
and C/C++ skills.

## Running

This project uses `g++` and requires an image viewer that supports the
.ppm file format.

**PPM Demo**
In order to run the ppm demo, navigate to `src/` and run `make ppm-demo`.
The output should be visible in `src/demo.ppm`.

**RT Demo**
In order to run the rt demo, navigate to `src/` and run `make rt-demo`.
The output should be visible in `src/demo.ppm`.
